This project delves into predictive modeling by assessing bagging and boosting regression techniques applied to insurance data. The dataset includes predictors like age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and historical charges.

The primary goal is to compare the predictive performance of bagging and boosting regression methods in accurately estimating insurance claim amounts. Bagging involves training multiple regression models on bootstrapped subsets of the data and aggregating their predictions, while boosting iteratively improves model performance by focusing on misclassified instances.

Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared will be employed to assess the accuracy and reliability of the models. By analyzing the performance of bagging and boosting regression on insurance data, this project aims to determine the most effective approach for predicting claim amounts.

Insights derived from this analysis can inform insurance companies about optimal regression techniques for risk assessment and pricing strategies. Additionally, the project contributes to advancing the understanding of bagging and boosting techniques in regression tasks and their practical applications in insurance analytics.
